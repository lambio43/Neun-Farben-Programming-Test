# Neun-Farben-Programming-Test

A part of the game I am most proud of and want to showcase would be my recreation of strafe jumping.
I tried to recreate the Source Engine movement but failed.
So I tried to do it my way which in I make it so that by strafe jumping the player can go faster but normal movement is much slower.
Because of this movement jumping from one platform to another is much more harder if you try to go fast
