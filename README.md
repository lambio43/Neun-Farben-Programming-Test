# Neun-Farben-Programming-Test

A part of the game I am most proud of and want to showcase would be my recreation of Genji's dash mechanic in overwatch,
wherein the dash's cooldown is reset when killing an enemy. Another thing that I am proud would be is that I was able to use
the state machine to change the enemy's animation, plus being able to make the enemy's AI to change state when it get into its destination
and after facing towards the next destination.
